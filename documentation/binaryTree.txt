Binary Tree:
	-tree-type structure
	-non-linear structure

Characteristics:
	-Root node is the top of the hierachy and it is not preceded by any other node.
	-Each node within a BT data structure has at most 2 children per node (left and right child).	

	e.g of a Node class in python language

	#class Node:
	# def __init__(self,val=0, left=None, right=None)
	#	self.val=val
	#	self.left=left
	#	self.right=right 

	-Root node is the top of the hierarchy. 

		      	       4    <- root node 
                              / \
      	     left child ->   2   5   <- right child
methods:
Basics:
	-Insert: Whenever a Node is required to be inserted, there are some rules that must be followed.
		1. Compare new node value with root value
		2. If the value is less than root's value, move to the left, otherwise, move to the right.
		3. Repeat the proccess until you find a 'leave node' without left or right child
		4. assign new node to the leaf left/right node reference.
	-Removing:
	-Searching:
	-Traversing the tree:
		

Auxiliart:
	-height
	-find level of a node
	-size
